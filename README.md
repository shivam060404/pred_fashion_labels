# Fashion Clothing Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model classifies grayscale images into 10 different clothing categories with high accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization for optimal training
- CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers
- Complete training pipeline with validation
- Performance visualization and evaluation
- Inference demonstration on test data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Dataset
The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset which consists of:
- 60,000 training images (55,000 for training, 5,000 for validation in this implementation)
- 10,000 test images
- 28x28 pixel grayscale images
- 10 clothing categories:
  1. T-shirt/top
  2. Trouser
  3. Pullover
  4. Dress
  5. Coat
  6. Sandal
  7. Shirt
  8. Sneaker
  9. Bag
  10. Ankle boot

## Model Architecture
The CNN consists of:
1. Convolutional layer: 32 filters with 3x3 kernel and ReLU activation
2. MaxPooling layer: 2x2 pool size
3. Flatten layer: to convert 2D feature maps to 1D feature vectors
4. Dense layer: 300 neurons with ReLU activation
5. Dense layer: 100 neurons with ReLU activation
6. Output layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation (one for each clothing category)

## Training Process
- Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Epochs: 70
- Batch size: 64
- Training/Validation split: 55,000/5,000 images

## Performance
The model achieves good accuracy on the test dataset. Performance metrics include:
- Training and validation accuracy curves
- Training and validation loss curves
- Final test accuracy evaluation

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset
2. Split data into training, validation, and test sets
3. Build and compile the CNN model
4. Train the model with validation
5. Evaluate the model on test data
6. Make predictions on new fashion images

## Implementation Details
- Images are normalized to values between 0 and 1
- Images are reshaped to include the channel dimension (28x28x1)
- Training progress is monitored using validation data

## Future Improvements
- Implement data augmentation techniques
- Try deeper network architectures
- Experiment with different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop)
- Add dropout layers to reduce overfitting
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance
